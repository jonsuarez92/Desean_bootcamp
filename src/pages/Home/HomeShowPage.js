                            <p >Each week you will learn a new topic to add to your arsenal to make you a SNIPER! Some subjects include psychology, risk management/stoploss,
                                choosing the right contracts, etc. My goal is to help each and every one of you navigate through this market with the confidence to propel
                                you to become a self sufficient trader! There is nothing wrong with being is group chats, but you NEED to know how to maneuver yourself. After these next 3 weeks, you should have a better grasp on the market overall.
